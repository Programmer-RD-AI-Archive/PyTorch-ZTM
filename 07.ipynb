    "\n",
    "A machine learning research paper is a scientific paper that details findings of a research group on a specific area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of a machine learning research paper can vary from paper to paper but they generally follow the structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Section** | **Contents** |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- | \n",
    "| **Abstract** | An overview/summary of the paper's main findings/contributions. |\n",
    "| **Introduction** | What's the paper's main problem and details of previous methods used to try and solve it. |\n",
    "| **Method** | How did the researchers go about conducting their research? For example, what model(s), data sources, training setups were used? |\n",
    "| **Results** | What are the outcomes of the paper? If a new type of model or training setup was used, how did the results of findings compare to previous works? (this is where **experiment tracking** comes in handy) |\n",
    "| **Conclusion** | What are the limitations of the suggested methods? What are some next steps for the research community? |\n",
    "| **References** | What resources/other papers did the researchers look at to build their own body of work? |\n",
    "| **Appendix** | Are there any extra resources/findings to look at that weren't included in any of the above sections? |"
